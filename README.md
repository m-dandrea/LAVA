# land-analysis-and-eligibility

This repo provides tools to calculate the eligible area in a user defined study region for building renewable energies like solar PV and wind onshore.
To do so, multiple steps need to be caried out including a detailed land analysis to have a better understanding of the study region.

## 0. Files setup
__a) clone the repository:__

`% git clonehttps://github.com/jome1/land-analysis-and-eligibility.git`

After cloning, navigate to the top-level folder of the repo.

__b) install python dependencies__

The Python package requirements to use these tools are in the `requirements.yml` file. You can install these requirements in a new environment using `conda`:

`conda env create -f envs/requirements.yaml`

Then activate this new environment using

`conda activate land_analysis`

You are now ready to run the scripts in this repository.


## 1. Download the necessary raw spatial data
Create a folder named __"Raw_Spatial_Data"__. Inside that folder create two more folder named __"gebco"__ and __"OSM"__.

Following data must be downloaded:
* [GEBCO Gridded Bathymetry Data](https://download.gebco.net/) using the download tool. Select a larger area around your study region. Set a tick for a GeoTIFF file under "Grid" and download the file from the basket. Put the file into the folder __"gebco"__. This data provides the elevation in each pixel.
* [CORINE land cover global dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/3939050) from zenodo, leave the name as it is and put it in the __"Raw_Spatial_Data"__ folder.
* [OpenStreetMap Shapefile](https://download.geofabrik.de/) of the country where your study region is located. Click on the relevant continent and then country to download the ´.shp.zip´. Unzip and put the country folder inside the __"OSM"__-folder.



## 2. Spatial data preparation
The script `spatial_data_prep_JOM.py` performs multiple data preprocessing steps to facilitate the land analysis and land eligibility study:
* download administrative boundary of the study region from gadm.org using the package pygadm
* calculate the local UTM zone
* clip and reproject to local UTM zone OSM railways, land cover data and elevation data
The files are saved to a folder within the __"data"__-folder.

In the beginning of the script you can select:
* `only_mainland = ` __0__ (use all polygons of the study region) or __1__ (use only the biggest polygon). This comes in handy when looking at countries with Island like Portugal and you only want to study the mainland of Portugal.
* `GOAS =` __0__ (don't change, work in progress)
* `consider_OSM =` __0__ (don't use OSM data in study region) or __1__ (clip OSM data to study region). Currently, only railways are considered.
* `EPSG_manual =` __*'EPSG-Code'*__ (insert EPSG code like 3035 for Europe if you want to set it manually instead of using the calculated UTM zone) or keep it an __*empty string*__

Moreover, you have to select your study region. It has to be an official administrative region from GADM.org:
* `country_code =` __*'country_code_as_string'*__ (3 letters ISO code)
* `gadm_level =` __*int*__ (administrative level)
* `region_name =` __*'region_name_as_string'*__ (name of the region)
Ideally you download the geopackage of the country you are interested in and load it in QGIS to find the right `gadm_level` and `region_name`.



## 3. Land analysis
With the JupyterNotebook `data_exploration.ipynb` you can inspect the spatial data of your study region.
In the second code cell just put the name of your study region as the folder with the preprocessed data is named. Additionally, put the right name of your landcover_source to fetch the correct legend and color dictionary.
